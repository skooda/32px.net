# 32px.net 
The ultimate 32x32 pixel size webpage.

Hosted on [https://www.32px.net](https://www.32px.net).

## WTF?
This is a case study I did for fun to prove that it is possible to create a fully functional website on a 32x32 pixel canvas. 

During the creation process, a separate [minipixel font](src/fonts/) was also created with characters max 5px high.

The styles are handled by a kind of framework that takes advantage of the fact that the 32px space is very small, so that I was able to create a funny hacks [like this](src/styles/positioning.css) :)

## Build
Clone repo and just run `make`, that will generate a `www` directory with contents
